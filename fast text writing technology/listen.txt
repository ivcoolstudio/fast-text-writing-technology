to start automatic text writing, there are two options 1 option - enter the text speed in the upper line with a fractional value 
(the lower the value, the faster) and in the lower line of the text you want to write, then you need to press ok and use the shift 
key and text input will begin 2 option - close 1 window and take a screenshot of the area where the text is located, then restart the 
program, specify the speed in the first line (you do not need to touch the bottom one), press ok and after using the ctrl key, text 
input will begin.
